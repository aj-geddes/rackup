# Your League Deserves Better

You run a pool league. You've got teams to organize, matches to schedule, standings to track, and players who want to know where they rank. You've probably tried spreadsheets, Facebook groups, or maybe even one of those expensive league management services that charges you per player.

**There's a better way.**

Rackup is a complete league management system that you own and control. It costs about $5 a month to run, it works beautifully on phones, and you don't need to be technical to set it up.

## The Problem We Solve

Running a league is hard enough without fighting your tools. Most league organizers end up:

- **Buried in spreadsheets** that break when someone edits the wrong cell
- **Paying monthly fees** to services that charge per team or per player
- **Stuck on desktop** while players want mobile access at the bar
- **Worrying about data** that lives on someone else's server

We built Rackup because we've been there. We wanted something that just works, doesn't break the bank, and puts you in control.

## What It Costs

Here's the honest breakdown:

| What | Cost | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **Railway hosting** | $5/month | This runs your league. That's it. No per-player fees. |
| **Text message invites** | ~$0.01/text | Optional. You can share invite links manually instead. |
| **Google Drive backups** | Free | Optional. You can download backups manually instead. |

**Most leagues run for $5-7 per month total.** Compare that to league management services that charge $50-200+ per season.

## The Story Behind Rackup

This started because a local women's pool league needed a better way to manage things. The existing options were either too expensive, too complicated, or too ugly on mobile.

We wanted to build something that:

1. **Anyone could afford** - Not just big leagues with big budgets
2. **Anyone could set up** - Without being a programmer
3. **Anyone could trust** - With their league's data
4. **Everyone could use** - On whatever device they have

So we built Rackup and made it free for anyone to use.

### Why Railway?

We chose [Railway](https://railway.app) as the recommended hosting platform because:

- **It's simple** - Connect your code, add a database, done
- **It's affordable** - $5/month for the Hobby plan covers most leagues
- **It's reliable** - Your league stays online without you babysitting servers
- **It scales** - If your league grows, Railway grows with you

You're not locked into Railway. Rackup runs anywhere that runs Docker. But for most leagues, Railway is the easiest path from "I want a league website" to "My league has a website."

## Is This Right For Your League?

Rackup is a great fit if:

- You have **6-50 teams** (it handles more, but this is the sweet spot)
- You want **mobile access** for players and captains
- You're tired of **spreadsheet chaos**
- You want to **own your data** instead of renting it

Rackup might not be right if:

- You need **tournament brackets** (we focus on regular season play)
- You want **live scoring** during matches (we do post-match entry)
- You need **integration with APA/BCA** (we're independent)

## Ready to Get Started?

Setting up takes about 15-20 minutes. You'll need:

- A computer (just for setup - after that it's all mobile-friendly)
- A credit card (for the $5/month Railway hosting)
- Your league's basic info (name, your email, etc.)
